## Assignment
The goal of this assignment was to classify, as accurately as possible, handwritten characters taken from the EMNIST dataset 
(https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset). Each character image was represented as 28-by-28 pixels in gray
scale, being stored as a row vector of 784 elements (28 Ã— 28 = 784). This coursework was completed using MATLAB 2015.

### Task 1
Using K-NN classification.

### Task 2
Using Naive Bayes classification with multivariate Bernoulli distributions.

### Task 3
#### Task 3A
Using Bayes classification with Gaussian distributions, where each class (character) is modelled with a multivariate Gaussian
distribution.

#### Task 3B
Same as done in 3A, with the addition of a K-means clustering algorithm. Each class was divided into different clusters to
achieve a more accurate prediction.
