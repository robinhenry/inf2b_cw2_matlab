function [Cpreds] = my_knn_classify(Xtrn, Ctrn, Xtst, Ks)
% Function for k-NN classification using squared Euclidean distance measure.

% Inputs:
%   Xtrn: M-by-D training data matrix (double). 
%       M: number of training samples
%       D: number of elements in a sample
%   Ctrin: M-by-1 label vector for Xtrn.
%   Xtst: N-by-D test data matrix.
%       N: number of test samples
%   Ks: L-by-1 vector of numbers of nearest neighbours.
% Output:
%   Cpreds: N-by-L matrix of predicted class labels for Xtst.
%       Cpreds(i,j) is the predicted class for Xtst(i,:) with the number of nearest 
%       neighbours being Ks(j).

% Matrix sizes
M = size(Xtrn, 1);          % number of training samples
D = size(Xtrn, 2);          % number of elements in a sample
N = size(Xtst, 1);          % number of test samples
L = size(Ks, 2);            % number of different k-values to use

% Initialise return matrix
Cpreds = zeros(N, L);

% Compute distances between each test sample and each training sample
distances = zeros(N,M);

    distances(i,:) = square_dist(Xtrn, Xtst(i,:));
    fprintf("Row %d\n", i);

% Sort the distances between each test sample and all the training samples
[dist_sorted, idx] = sort(distances, 2, 'ascend');          % idx = N-by-M matrix
